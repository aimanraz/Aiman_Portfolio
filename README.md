# My Data Science Portfolio
A data science portfolio with some cool and interesting project!

# [Application Tool To Predict Resistance Spot Welding Weld Quality](https://github.com/aimanraz/rsw-deep-learning.git) 
* Developed an application tool that use deep learning to predict the weld quality of resistance spot welding. 
* The dataset that has been used for this project based on [this research paper.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261306908001301)
* This application tool consist of 6 tab which each tab have their own puposes.
* This project used only open-source software and packages.
* This application tool can only be used on windows platform.
* Some of the ANN model hyperparameter can be tuned, and some of it have been set to default.
* This project used supervised learning mechanism.

# Breast Cancer Detection using Logistic Regression (coming soon!)


# More Analysis (coming soon!)
Stay tune for more interesting analysis! 


# Machine Learning Project (coming soon!)
Currently making my fundamentals about ML more robust.
